# How to

To get a Git project into your build:

**Step 1.**  Add the JitPack repository to your build file

-   [gradle](https://jitpack.io/#gradle)
-   [maven](https://jitpack.io/#maven)
-   [sbt](https://jitpack.io/#sbt)
-   [leiningen](https://jitpack.io/#lein)

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```css
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.**  Add the dependency

```css
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.hoangvuanhdevelopervn:FreeImage:Tag'
	}

```

Share this release:

[Link](https://jitpack.io/#hoangvuanhdevelopervn/FreeImage/Tag)

**That's it!**  The first time you request a project JitPack checks out the code, builds it and serves the build artifacts (jar, aar).

If the project doesn't have any  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software)  you can use the short commit hash or 'master-SNAPSHOT' as the version.
